Known bugs

- Game becomes super trippy when the player gets stuck between two bumper walls.
- A test can't be replayed when you die from going off-screen (camera offset needs to be reset).
- Lasers do not spawn at the location you put the placeholder.
- You can create and save an empty set.
- Objects can overlap each other and be placed outside the boundary walls.
	- The objects turn red as an indication that they're overlapping. However, nothing happens with this information.
- Dragging an object to the trashcan only works when it's not overlapping with the bottom boundary wall.



- The first set you make in the mobile version is never saved. (FIXED)
- Dying to a laser will always bring you to a normal game. (FIXED)
- Objects spawn a few pixels higher when you play a costum game (FIXED)
- Objects that are spawned by enemies (splitting enemy and engaging enemy) don't disappear after a failed test. (FIXED)
