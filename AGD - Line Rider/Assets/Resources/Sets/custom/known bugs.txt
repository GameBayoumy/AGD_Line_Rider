Known bugs

- Game becomes super trippy when the player gets stuck between two bumper walls.
- A test can't be replayed when you die from going off-screen (camera offset needs to be reset).
- Objects that are spawned by enemies (splitting enemy and engaging enemy) don't disappear after a failed test.
	-Luckily, they are not part of your custom set. It just looks weird.
- Lasers spawn at the center of the placeholder.
- Dying to a laser while testing your set, brings you to a normal game.
- You can create and save an empty set.
- Objects can overlap each other and be placed outside the boundary walls.
	- The objects turn red as an indication that they're overlapping. However, nothing happens with this information.
- Dragging an object to the trashcan only works when it's not overlapping with the bottom boundary wall.
