Mobile Solution

- About 20 empty custom sets are made in the project.
- Each of these custom sets has a script that contains an ID.
- When you save a custom set, all objects and positions of that set are stored in the PlayerPrefs.
- For example: Set1Object1 can be "ChasingEnemy", which means a chasing enemy is spawned.
- Set1Object1X and Set1Object1Y contain the local position of this object.
- Whenever the first set is spawned, it checks the PlayerPrefs for all the objects it needs to spawn and positions it needs to set.
